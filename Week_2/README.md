# Andela BootCamp Labs
## Ticket Booking Service Project


### Introduction

This is a repository containing all the files needed for Ticket Booking Service Project done for the Andela Cohort X BootCamp Week 2. 

### Objectives
For this project, we will be creating a service for use at service stations where ticket bookings can be made. We should be able to create events, delete events, edit event and generate tickets (of various types).

As a user, you should be able to perform the following operations:
* `event create <event_details>` - Creates a new event in the database table. Event details should contain the following fields
  * Event name
  * Event start date
  * Event end date
  * Event venue
* `event delete <event_id>` - Deletes an existing event from the database table.
* `event edit <event_id> <new_event_details>` - Edit an already existing event from the database.
* `event list` - Lists all the events in the database
* `event view <event_id> `- View all the tickets that have been generated for that event.
