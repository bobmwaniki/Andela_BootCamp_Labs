# Andela BootCamp Labs - Day 1


### Introduction

This is a repository for all the labs and tests written for the Andela Cohort X bootcamp for Day 1. The files are divided according to the day of the bootcamp in which they were done

### Requirements

No special requirements. You can run the python files using idle.

### Tests 
Each lab is written as a separate python file with the test file having the word 'test_' as the prefix. For example, for `some_python_lab.py`, the accompantying test file would be named `test_some_python_lab.py`

### Car_Class_lab
##### Instructions
You are to create a `Car` class that can be used to instantiate various vehicles.
It takes in arguments that depict the type, model, and name of the vehicle, provided they are set.
Let the test guide you to building your Car boiler-plate.

### Data_Types_lab
##### Instructions
Define a function called data_type, to take one argument. Compare and return results, based on the argument supplied to the function. Complete the test to produce the perfect function that accounts for all expectations.

* For `strings`, return its length.
* For `None` return `string` `'no value'`
* For `booleans` return the boolean
* For `integers` return a string showing how it compares to hundred e.g. For 67 return 'less than 100' for 4034 return 'more than 100' or equal to 100 as the case may be
* For `lists` return the 3rd item, or None if it doesn't exist

### Fizz_Buzz_lab

Create a function fizz_buzz to return `'Fizz'`, `'Buzz'`, `'FizzBuzz'`, or the argument it receives, all depending on the argument of the function, a number that is divisible by, 3, 5, or both 3 and 5, respectively.

When the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, the number itself should be returned.
