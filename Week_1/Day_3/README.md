# Andela BootCamp Labs - Day 3


### Introduction

This is a repository for all the labs and tests written for the Andela Cohort X bootcamp for Day 3. The files are divided according to the day of the bootcamp in which they were done

### Requirements

No special requirements. You can run the python files using idle.

### Tests 
Each lab is written as a separate python file with the test file having the word 'test_' as the prefix. For example, for `some_python_lab.py`, the accompantying test file would be named `test_some_python_lab.py`

### Binary_Search_lab
##### Instructions
First, you are to create a `BinarySearch` class, that inherits from the list class the following:

the `__init__()` takes two integers as parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is the `length` of the list to be created and `b` is the `step` or difference between consecutive values. It should also initialize an instance variable `length`, that returns the number of elements in the array

Once you are done, create another method called `search`, it will take just one argument which is the value you are to find. The search function should return a dictionary object, which contains

`count`, the number of times you function iterated to find the index of the number in question index, the `index` of the number in question

The `search` method should implement the binary search algorithm, each time you iterate, you should increase the count, to test how efficient your implementation is.
 

### Missing_Number_lab
##### Instructions
You are presented with two arrays, all containing positive integers. One of the arrays will have one extra number, see below:

`[1,2,3]` and `[1,2,3,4]` should return `4`

`[4,66,7]` and `[66,77,7,4]` should return `77`


### HTML_Simple_User_Interface_lab
##### Instructions
GitHub repo containing a clone of a simple user interface created using HTML and CSS.
